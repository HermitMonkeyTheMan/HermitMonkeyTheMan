## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Harvard's CS50x to refresh since it's been 8 years since I was in college for CS.
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning version control and refreshing my basics.
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! I need experience working with a team in this setting.
ğŸ“« How to reach me: HermitMonkeyTheMan@gmail.com
âš¡ Fun fact: I live off grid in the middle of nowhere in the desert.
